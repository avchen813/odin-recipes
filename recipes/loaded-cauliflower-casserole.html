    <p><em>Cauliflower just got loaded -- like a baked potato, that is. All the familiar flavors of your favorite stuffed spud are in this cheesy casserole that is low in carbs and high in flavor.</em></p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 slices bacon, cut 1/2-inch thick</li>
        <li>2 medium heads cauliflower, cut into bite-size florets (3 to 4 pounds total)</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>6 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar</li>
        <li>4 scallions, white and light green parts only, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2/3 cup sour cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat over to 425 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Cook the bacon in a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until brown and crispy, 6 to 7 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate. Reserve 2 tablespoons of the bacon drippings.  </li>
        <li>Put the cauliflower florets in a 3-quart casserole dish. Toss with the reserved 2 tablespoons bacon drippings, 3/4 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Roast until the florets are soft and begin to brown, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, mix together the cream cheese and 1 cup of the Cheddar in a medium bowl until well combined. Dollop over the cauliflower, then sprinkle with the remaining 1 cup Cheddar and bake until the cauliflower is tender when poked with a knife and the Cheddar is melted and bubbly, 5 to 7 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Dollop the sour cream evenly over the casserole and sprinkle with the scallions and reserved bacon pieces.</li>
    </ol>
